          <p>The Drug Use Disorders Identification Test <strong>(DUDIT)</strong> and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test <strong>(AUDIT)</strong> are widely recognized screening tools developed to assess the presence and severity of <strong>drug use</strong> disorders and <strong>alcohol use</strong> disorders, respectively. These tests were developed by experts in the field of addiction and mental health to provide a <strong>standardized way</strong> to identify individuals who may be at risk of developing substance use disorders or are already experiencing problematic substance use.</p>

            <p>The DUDIT assessment is divided into three sections, each targeting different aspects of drug use. The questions inquire about the frequency of drug use, inability to stop drug use, interference with responsibilities, withdrawal symptoms, engagement in risky situations due to drug use, and more. Each question is assigned a point value based on the response, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of a drug use disorder</p></p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold">Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test</h3>
            <p>The AUDIT is divided into two sections. The first section addresses alcohol consumption patterns, including the frequency of drinking and the quantity consumed per occasion. The second section explores alcohol-related problems, such as inability to control drinking, interference with daily responsibilities, and the need for alcohol consumption in the morning to relieve withdrawal symptoms</p></p>
